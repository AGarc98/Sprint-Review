# Sprint-Review

While working on a program it is important to keep in mind the user and how they might use it. User stories are useful for this, and also for considering other possible desing and implementations of features.

Making sure to keep an open mind and being flexible are key to implementing an agile development process. The other key would be proper communication with the team to make sure everyone is on the same page about the development.

Being a good team member means doing these things like communicating and staying in the loop of your work and your teams work. Working together effectively is truly what makes an agile team work.
